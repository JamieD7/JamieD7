<h1>Hi, I'm Jamie! 👋</h1>

I'm a cybersecurity student passionate about threat detection, SIEM systems, and building hands-on labs to explore real-world security challenges. I love turning complex security concepts into practical projects that demonstrate skills in monitoring, logging, and incident response.
